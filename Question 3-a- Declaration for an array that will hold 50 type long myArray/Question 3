 Question 3(f)
What is wrong with the following code fragment (MAXVALUES is not the problem !)
    
    for (counter = 1; counter < MAXVALUES; counter++ );
    printf("\nCounter = %d", counter);

Answer:
    
    
    
    Because the for loop has bee terminated with (;), the code after it will
    always be executed separately from it
